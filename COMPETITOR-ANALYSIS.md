## Legal/Terms Patterns

### GetMyBoat approach (marketplace)
- "GETMYBOAT IS A VENUE AND IS NOT A PARTY TO ANY RENTAL AGREEMENT"
- All liability on operators and renters
- Mutual indemnification
- Insurance is operator's responsibility (GetMyBoat doesn't offer it)
- Weather cancellation at captain's sole discretion
- Separate waivers between renter and operator

### Boatsetter approach (marketplace)
- Three cancellation tiers: Flexible (24hr), Moderate (5 day), Strict (30 day)
- Extenuating circumstances override (named storms within 150mi, govt weather emergencies)
- Platform can override cancellation policy for safety

### SaaS approach (Peek/FareHarbor)
- Software provider, not party to transaction
- Operator sets all policies
- Platform just processes
